DESCRIPTION
___________
Fixed Vanilla Models & Textures. "FV-M&T" for short, "FVM" for shorter and much more memorable.
After playing Anomaly for such a time, using no model mods whatsoever, I have noticed that the game, sadly, has so many, many flaws in its models.

Some examples:
* Many textures are missing mipmaps, making some textures look like an edged oversharpened mess.
* Some models have smoothing errors, making them look like a complete blocky mess. Especially prevalent on Nosorogs, ExoSEVAs and Protoexos.
* Some models have "repeated textures", to fix this I instead kept as such but completely changed the texture.
* Almost all factions have a "camo facemask" head variant that is so low quality it belongs in Counter-Strike 1.6 instead.
* All Monolith have a "full black camo" that looks like it was overlayed on the whole texture, completely ugly and unfit.
* Mercenaries have quite the variety of low-quality (re)textures.
* Ecologists could have been better instead of a single color that can make you confuse them for Mercenaries.
[For more information, check "DETAILS" below]

So, with all that in mind, I just got tired and went ahead and fixed almost all of them the best I could.
This took more than a year to make, and I do hope all the work done will be worth it for all of you, if it makes you to even at least give it a try despite being completely in favour of "HD Models", I am flattered you'd do so.

DO NOTE!
I do not have any intention to "HDify" anything, this pack was made ONLY to fix issues, be it technical or visual.
Knowing this, do not expect a massive visual improvement.
It may or may not be more performance heavy, this has not been tested, but it is doubtful that you'll get an extreme FPS drop.
(If anything, your FPS will increase thanks to these mipmaps)
Also, some models will not be changed simply because they're so low-quality they shouldn't even be in the game. For example...Monolith Patchwork SEVAs, the "Helmet" variants, some LC Suit variants.
I recommend you use this mod with "Less Ugly Variety" (LUV) in combination, so you can remove the ugly models like Monolith Patchwork SEVAs.
___________
INSTALLATION
___________

Simply extract the "gamedata" folder into your STALKER Anomaly directory.

New game is not required, since this is meant to be only a Models & Texture changer.
You can also install and uninstall anytime, but please be careful with the addons.
___________
OPTIONS/ADDONS INFORMATION
___________

- UNISG Overhaul. Completely redoes UNISG visual style, including camo and colour.
The main colour shall now be light gray, with a very bright Green and Red highlight.
- 'Wind of Freedom' Variants. Adds more variants for Wind of Freedom, up to 6.
(If you install it, you cannot uninstall unless you also make a new game, since the game will crash due to missing meshes)
- SEVA Glass Variety. Adds various different types of SEVA Glass to SEVA armors instead of being just one single blueish tint.
In other words, Duty will use a beautiful golden tint, Loners will be a Greenish tint with some Orange and Monolith will use a bizarre Pinkish with Teal.
___________
COMPATIBILITY
___________

The mod will conflict with anything that changes the models and textures.
Popular mods such as "Dux's Innumerable Character Kit" and "Armor Balance Collection" are compatible by default. Besides, they use a lot of materials from FVM.
Not compatible with "HD Models" because they're both completely unrelated.

DETAILS
___________

_____TEXTURES_____
-ALL-
* SEVA Glass was a badly compressed 128x128 texture taken from Build 1964. It has been completely redone, at 256x256, with a proper normal & specular map, picking the good from Build 1964, ShoC and CoP.
* The STS Suit, also known as X-18 Suit, didn't have a proper normal map. I have manually painted one.
* "Specnaz Glass", a shared texture between the Beril & SKAT-9 visors, has a much better specular map now.
* Two face variants that had green masks were missing their normal maps. This has been fixed.
* All modern Russian gasmasks (such as those on the SKAT-9M) had broken visors. This has been fixed, back to the original orange tinted one.
* Most if not all SEVAs (Loner, Merc, Freedom) backpacks had bad textures, broken normal maps or no mipmaps. This has been fixed.
* Proto-Exos' Skeleton had a terrible bumpmap, an original from ShoC has been restored.
* GP-5 Mask has bad compression errors, no normal map and no mipmaps. It has been given all.
* "Digital Black&Orange Camo" face has been replaced with good ol' classic ShoC green-cloth face. Also known as "The Green Stalker".

-ZOMBIFIED-
* One face variant was just a "painted on" balaclava based on the Balaclava's face. This has been replaced with a proper Zombified face.
* One face variant was just a "painted on" balaclava based on the Green Stalker's face. This has been replaced with a proper Zombified face.
* "Ecologist Zombies" were missing mipmaps and normal maps. This has been fixed.

-LONER-
* "Loner Trenchcoat" had missing Normal Maps. This has been fixed.
* "Rookie Jacket" Normal Map was a bit broken, especially on the Specular Map. This has been fixed.
* One of "Rookie Jacket" variants, "Camo", was nothing more than a darkened and camo-all-overlayed texture. It has been replaced with a proper bright camo, including pants and dark misc parts.
* One of "Rookie Jacket" variants, a green-toned type, had some consistency issues. This has been fixed.
* One of "Rookie Jacket" variants, just a plain forest camo, has been redone with a blue leather jacket that has some "edgy" urban camo parts to it and greenish pants.
* One of "Rookie Jacket" variants, which was just "Freedom Rookie" camo but desaturated, has been replaced with the classic "White Urban" from ShoC.
* "Sunrise Suit" had no Mipmaps, this has been fixed.
* "Sunrise Suit Variant 2", Salamander, had part of his shoulders fixed and his gastank redone.
* "Sunrise Suit Variant 3", Graphite, had part of his shoulders fixed and his pads redone to be a static colour instead of camo.
* "Sunrise Suit Variant 4", Drought, has been overhauled: It now uses a dark torso with green highlights, pads are dark green and clothing has better camo more fit for a dry swamp.
* "Sunrise Suit Variant 5", Tigerstripe, had part of his shoulders fixed.
* "Sunrise Suit Variant 6", Autumn, has been overhauled: Uses a completely different camo, more fit for Autumn/Fall, shoulderpads fixed and other enhancements.
* "Wastelander" had the leatherpads changed to brown, added some more black decor to it and fixed the shoulders. Also was missing normal map, restored.
* Original "Exoskeleton", with original colours has been restored.

-BANDIT-
* "Bandit Sunrise" has been overhauled, to be an actual Sunrise instead of an STS suit. It is made to appear like a rough craftsmanship and scavenged unpainted equipment.
* "Bandit Jacket" Normal Map was a bit broken, especially on the Specular Map. This has been fixed.
* One of "Bandit Rookie" variants, red&black letterman jacket, has been replaced with an intricate Red&Black Leather Jacket.
* All variants of the "Bandit Rookie" were using the wrong normal map, it now uses the proper one.
* The original "Bandit Trenchcoat" somehow had a SEAMLESS METAL hood texture and mipmaps broken. This has all been fixed by using the original CoP texture instead.
* One of the Bandit/Looted LC Suits was just a darker version of the original. It is now a "palette swap", where the clothing is black and the armor is brown instead.
* Bandit Exoskeletons have been overhauled, as well as given their proper .thm files so they have a normal map.

-CLEAR SKY-
* All Clear Sky textures were at 1024x1024, they have been restored to 2048x2048 with less compression artifacts. In detail:
	- CS-1a was using a camo clothmask and badly-made metal spaulders, now it's back to the default blue-gray and green leather spaulders
	- CS-1b had a variant that used an unfit and badly made "Digital Camo" as well as its normal maps were broken.
	Normal maps are fixed, original restored and the other variant is now an intricate one with green pants.
	- CS-2 was desaturated and added a green filter, with some bad artifacting on the glass. This has been fixed.
	- CS-3a had an incredibly desaturated look, especially on the armor. Original color has been restored.
	- CS-3b had a variant that used an unfit and badly made "Digital Camo".
	Original restored and the other variant is now the same but with black pants.
* Clear Sky "Sunrise" has been overhauled, fixing the issues it had such as no mipmaps, bad texture clipping, broken pants and camo. It now uses proper camo, almost fitting CS-1a itself, has black pants and fixed pouches.
* New Clear Sky "Sunrise" variant that uses "Twilight" torso and camo hood.
* Clear Sky "Exosuit" had no mipmaps, now it does.
* Clear Sky "Exolight" had no mipmaps, no normal map and was identical to the Exosuit anyway. Now it has black torso instead of camo and uses mipmaps & normal map.
* Clear Sky "SKAT" completely overhauled, it now uses a much better texture, with better camo, set mipmaps and a proper normal map.
* "Clear Sky SEVA" Variant 1, the STS, was using an improper normal map. This has been fixed.
* "Clear Sky SEVA" Variant 2, the one 4x2 Bumps torso, was using an improper normal map. This has been fixed.
* "Clear Sky SEVA" Variant 3, the PS5m-lookalike, was using a wrong normal map. This has been fixed.

-DUTY-
* One Duty face variant had missing normal maps. Restored.
* Duty's PS5-M was using an unfit normal map. This has been fixed thanks to "Dynamic".
* One "Duty SKAT" variant was using a 512x512 texture instead of 1024x1024. It's now back to 1024x1024. Also changed it to be a SKAT-9 (Plates).
* "SKAT Commander" was not too impressive, it has been redone to look amazing and unique, fit for an actual Frontlines Captain.
* Second Variant of Duty's PS5-M had some minor errors such as metal being painted red, missing some color and slightly broken shoulders. This has been fixed.
* Maskless PZD Dutyers were using the wrong normal map for their armor, now it uses the proper one.

-FREEDOM-
X [OPTIONAL] Freedom now has about 6 more "Wind of Freedom" variants, making up to 8.
All Variants have different wear and two kinds of armor textures for some diversity.
* "Wind of Freedom" had no proper normal map. I have manually painted one.
* One variant of the "Wind of Freedom" was using a texture that was a mishmash of the CS-3b, it now uses the original from SHoC again, but with changes such as blueish dark gray on details and some clothing and orange on metals.
* One of the "Sentinel of Freedom" variants were using an identical texture but lower in contrast. It is now a "Reverse Scheme" of the original.
* One of the "Guardian of Freedom" variants had a texture with no mipmaps, this has been fixed.
* Freedom SKAT has been completely overhauled, it is now a somewhat-flashy SKAT-9 & SKAT-9m combo, meaning it uses Plates and Gasmask respectively, with green flecktarn camo and blue&orange details. Also has functioning mipmaps, normal map and specular map.

-MERCENARY-
* [UNUSED IN-GAME BUT AVAILABLE IN-FILES] "SEVA/LC Combo Merc" were using very flat textures, it has now been edited to have minor details to further indicate they're part of the Mercs.
* "Merc/LC Suit" was using a different version that looked weird, with badly-painted pants and erroneous contrast on the armor, as well as missing mipmaps. The Original has been restored.
* "Sunrise Merc" was missing mipmaps and had wrong textures for the gastanks, this has been fixed.
* One of the "Sunrise Merc" variants was just the same but heavily darkened. It is now the Merc Sunrise with more decorational highlights. Also used the wrong normal map, fixed.
* "SEVA Merc" was using a texture with some wonky contrast and missing mipmaps. The Original has been restored.
* "Merc SKAT" has been overhauled, it now uses Merc Blue and has green highlights. Fits with the remodel.
* One of the "SEVAs" were using a wrong normal map, this has been fixed.
* One of the "Merc/LC Suit" variants, "Green", had the patches green itself that resembled Freedom's. It has been fixed back to Mercenary Blue, also added some further blue decorations to make sure he's easily spot as a Mercenary.
* One of the "Merc/LC Suit" variants, which uses a slate-gray desert camouflage, now uses another camouflage fit for Urban combat and only on the jumpsuit.
* One of the "Exos" variants, "Green Camo", was badly made and had green eyes and patches. This has been redone to be much better.
* "Proto-Exo Merc" was missing mipmaps, this has been fixed.
* All the "Exo" variants (ExoSEVA, Exosuit, Radsuit, etc) were using an unfit bright forest camo. The Original has been restored.
Also they had transparent eyes for some reason, unlike the others, this has been synchronized.

-MILITARY-
* SKAT-9 and SKAT-9M have been completely overhauled, with a much more improved normal map, new specular map and texture fixes.
* SKAT-9 Tinted Visors have been restored, previously they were transparent.
* Military SEVA has been overhauled to fit in with the overhauled model itself.
* Military Exoskeleton (and in turn, ExoSEVA) had a texture with no mipmaps and wasn't even using a normal map. This has been fixed.
* Military Exolight had a texture with no mipmaps and wasn't even using a normal map. This has been fixed.
(NOTE: This is also the "Woodland Exosuit", so it fixes more than just the Military Exolight)
* Soldiers & Spetsnaz had a lower-res texture with no mipmaps, this has been fixed.

-ECOLOGIST-
* Ecologist Proto-Exo had no normal map, now it does. This is thanks to "Dynamic".
* All "Ecomercs" had boring details, just some black or a lighter shade of blue and the Ecologist symbol, they have been revamped:
	- "Armored SEVA" Ecomerc now uses a blue-&-orange SEVA suit, with an orange backpack and better emblem. This will make him easily identifiable at a distance.
	- "Twilight" Ecomerc now uses SEVA/PS5 armor for the torso, while preserving the pouches in the belly and the oxygen tanks are fixed. Also has a blue-and-orange color scheme.
	- "LC Suit" Ecomerc now has many orange color scheme details, a better emblem and orange visors.
* Variant 2 of the Ecoguard has broken shoulders, this has been fixed,, as well as given orange tint to decorations to make him be spotted better. (It was easy to confuse him for a mercenary)
* Variant 3 of the Ecoguard has broken shoulders, this has been fixed.
* "SEVA Ecoguard" has broken shoulders, this has been fixed.
* "Orange Guard" Ecologists were using the wrong normal map, this has been fixed.

-MONOLITH-
* The weird digital camo that was applied over the whole texture and was badly compressed and saved with no mipmaps has been removed, now it uses the original Monolith armor textures instead.
* All "Old/ShoC" models were using wrong normal maps, new one was made from scratch for all.
* All "Old/ShoC" models now have 3 texture varieties; default camo, no camo green jumpsuit from Builds and Monolith Sunrise suit.
* All "New/CoP" models now have 3 texture varieties: default camo, Monolith Sunrise and Monolith PS5.
* One of the "face" model variants now have a different, better face and use Monolith Sunrise suit.
* One of the variants had a duplicate texture, it now uses a "Duty PS5M" recolored to be using Monolith Colors & Urban Camo.
* The default gasmasks were somehow colored green, this has been reverted back to light gray.
* "Monolith Exosuit" was using a terrible texture that looked like a mix of Army Suit and Exosuit, this has been fixed now.
* "Monolith SKAT" has been completely overhauled, also has mipmaps and a proper normal map.
* "Monolith ExoSEVA" was missing a normal map, this has been fixed.

-RENEGADES-
* "Renegade Exoskeleton" Variant 1 was broken and had missing normal map & mipmaps. It has been redone to resemble a Neutral Exoskeleton that has been looted.
* "Renegade Exoskeleton" Variant 2 has been redone to resemble a Looted Freedom & Duty Exoskeleton.
* "Renegade SEVA" has been redone to resemble a combination of looted Neutral SEVA & Monolith SEVA, taken from corpses and made patchworks.

-SIN-
Sin has been COMPLETELY overhauled. All textures may now use the new Sin Camo, which is some sort of flesh being torn apart to reveal a dark purple skin, fit for a Demon. The pattern is also meant to look like emission waves, fitting Sin even more.
* All Sin faces that had "red strips" have been decolorized and darkened.
* Sin Stalker Variant 1 is still a PS5, but this time with its own Dark Purple color.
* Sin Stalker Variant 2 is now a Sunrise instead, with the new standardized Camo and scheme fitting its "Dark Stalker" aspect.

LORE

Just in case you are either curious, worried or skeptical about something, I have put some "Lore Reasons"

"Sin Overhaul" Reasoning & Lore:
I always wanted to consider Sin as a Cultist type of faction but with some will of their own still; instead of simply brainwashing people to join their cause, they spread the word around to convince them that The Zone is alive and sacred instead.
They're not fools, they know they have very little members and may continue so, so instead of using Pawns as cannon-fodder, they equip them with their own armours taken from other factions, all dark to try to avoid being noticed. Hence the "Dark Stalker" lore.
While highly aggressive, they shouldn't be territorial except to their own territory and what they consider sacred; The Zone itself, which includes the Nuclear Plant and especially the Generators.
So, they mostly prefer being left alone, but don't mind sending missionaries to get more members. Despite having Pawns, they still treat them with some respect and not as just meat, unlike Monolith itself.
And in terms of their relationship with Monolith, Sin should be the new de facto bosses of "Monolith" instead, the ones who are actually pulling the strings now.

"UNISG Overhaul" Reasoning & Lore:
UNISG, by default, uses a ridiculous camo which may be a "temporal" solution to GSC's attempt at making ISG, then UNISG and then finally scrapping it (yet some very vague references are left out in Call of Pripyat's quest regarding a drone)
Instead of going for something more subtle, I've decided to keep the ridiculous aspect but also not go way to far, it's not a literal clown camo, it's a camo that MAY work, similar to the Clear Sky camo.
For that reason, they have those kind of camos instead.

"Ecologist Mercenary" Lore:
* They are Mercenaries, of course, paid by and affiliated to the Ecologists.
* Their job is not only to be the bodyguard, backup and sometimes guinea pig, but also the first one and hopefully only to get shot, or mauled by a mutant.
* So they generally get paid more than if they weren't working for the ecologists and should get much more advanced inventory, hence you see stuff like the Merc Twilight armor but with a PS5/SEVA torso armor instead (This one is also better for mutant attacks, anyway).
* All these emblems and new paint scheme is mostly done by request from the Ecologists, but also by the thinking of some Mercs (Not all mercies are dummies, you know?): Considering the Ecologists had quite the problems with mercs themselves, especially Wolfhound's team, even if somewhat neutral these days and Wolfhound is gone, they don't want to run any more risk, hence this color scheme.
* The very flashy orange is exactly for that reason; to be seen by others, especially Hunters, so not to be shoot by them.
But if that's a hostile human, that's fine, since as mentioned before they have to be the ones to be shot first, not the more important eggheads they are babysitting for.

"Monolith are SKAT-9 instead of SKAT-9M" Lore:
[SPOILER!]
If you have played the classic STALKER series, especially "Shadow of Chernobyl", then you will know that during the Siege of CNPP, the Military also took role and they sent their best, including "Military STALKERs", who wore the SKAT-9 armours. Back then there was no SKAT-9M, despite it appearing in "Clear Sky" which is the pre-sequel.
But whatever the case, in my view, I consider SKAT-9 to be an "older" variant of the SKAT itself, but still as good, only being just a bit bad for radiation and weight carry.
So for that reason, I think it would make sense that Monolith would have A LOT of re-acquired SKAT-9s and not SKAT-9Ms.

"Military SEVA" Reasoning:
I had some people get confused as to why the Military would use SEVAs. I believe the reason is very simple though: SEVA is a versatile suit made to be a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to zone exploration, where it sacrifices a bit of elemental resistance to add some to ballistics protection. For the Military, it may not be as important, but I expect SEVAs to be carried by Military STALKERs more often than not, so, it does make sense they'd use a combination of some SKAT parts with the SEVA.
___________
FEEDBACK/CONTACT
___________

For suggestions, it would be best if you first explain what should be done, and then why. Providing other information, such as screenshots, sources and the like is highly encouraged.
For bug reporting, it would be best if you provide a screenshot and if you can, the name of the object in question that has issues. This can be done with the Debug Menu, simply press F7 in-game while aiming at a model, then "Get Info" and screenshot that.
Also, explaining the issue in detail would be nice, if you know how, for example...It uses the wrong normal map, normal map is broken, specular is too high, texture is compressed badly, it has missing mipmaps, etc...

COPYRIGHT/LICENSE
___________

You are allowed to use this mod on other STALKER games (This includes the original series and major mods like Dead Air) AS LONG AS you provide credit to the original author, Blackgrowl, and you put a link to the original mod itself.
Taking textures from it is only allowed if you explicitly state that you are using FVM, put a link and credit the author (Blackgrowl), nothing else needs to be done. Putting it on other mods, even if it's the whole pack (modpack), follows the same rule as stated before.
There is a very high chance that "conflicts" will happen, in which case, simply tell the client to acquire and load FVM last so FVM textures are used. FVM will always be inherently the latest, as long as you don't change the texture names.
You are absolutely not allowed to get any monetary or commercial gain from this. Besides, that breaks GSC's license, so you'd be facing a whole company instead.
