Tired of the same old 5% upgrade package to your armour. I wanted to give you a real incentive to get that 3rd tier upgrade.

Any armour upgrade that increases protection by a % will increase by 5% as you advance through the armour upgrade tree.

1st row upgrade 5%
2nd row upgrade 10%
3rd row upgrade 15%

I have done this for all Protection stats (Wound, Electrical, Chemical, etc) and not any others like weight, or stamina, etc.

This won't work with any mod that changes the Upgrades to Armour.
