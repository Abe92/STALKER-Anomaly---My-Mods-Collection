Arszi's Mutant Bleeding 2.0.1

This addon makes mutants more realistic by making them bleed, leave blood trails and in some cases collapse if they are critically wounded. Also different type of ammounition will affect bleeding intensity differently.

Special thanks for Lucy, Grok, Xcvb, RavenAscendant and Jurkonov for supporting me.

Changelog:
HOTFIX 2.0.1
* Fixed a possible crash in case of burers
* Bleeding values for bones are enforced to be numbers when reading them from the config file

Installation:
Extract the "gamedata" folder in the zip file into your Anomaly folder.

Features:
* Version of 2.0 includes a bleeding mechanism based on the implementation of the engine, fed by the player's bleeding settings. Mutants will bleed more fairly than in Mutant Bleeding 1.0, with less intensity and longer duration.
* Tissue damage value in ammo descriptions shows how much the current amounition affects bleeding. The higher the tissue damage value is, the more bleeding it will result in (This does not affect damage on mutants, it affects bleeding only!).
* Meele weapons cause "high" and "very high" tissue damage, but this won't be written in their description always.
* Wounds on different body parts of mutants will give bonus to bleeding value. Head, neck and the second head of the Chimera receives 50% bonus compared to other body parts.
* Under 10% health, mutants with proper lying animations (Dog, psy dog, pseudodog, cat, boar, flesh, bloodsucker) will lie down, but might attack still if you go too close.
* Mutants will leave blood trails on the ground. The amount and size of blood marks depend on the number of wounds and intesity of their bleeding. Blood marks disappear after 30 seconds. Special thanks for Lucy who made this feature possible!

Some mutants, like poltergeist, zombies won't bleed because of technical reasons.

I allow my work to be used in other addons/mods as long as I receive the necessary credits!
