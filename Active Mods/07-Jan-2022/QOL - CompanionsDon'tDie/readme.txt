Tested for RC19 and RC21

This mod makes it so companions don't die, they just get critically injured. They will be on the floor until the healed some, then get back up to fight again. The companions also won't die from headshots.

Be careful because if they take too many bullets in 1 second it the game sometimes doesn't complete the callbacks to stop the damage, but normal enemies can't shoot this much (like if you unload a full mag into your companion).

They also won't die to grenades.



How to install:
Go into mod folder, and then inside you will see gamedata. Drag this gamedata folder into your game directory and overwrite files if asked.
